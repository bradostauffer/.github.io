  My name is Brayden Stauffer and I am a Computer Science student at the University of California, Davis.
This repository/portfolio contains both finished, and in progress projects that I have worked on for class, or on my 
free time. Feel free to explore my page and email me with any possible questions: bradostauffer@gmail.com.
