Once you have cloned this repository to your computer, you need to unzip the file in order for the game to use its assets properly. 
Once the folder is unzipped, you simply can just click on the "BunnyBattle.htm" and it should work if your browser is up-to-date.

Controls: spacebar jumps/hovers, "A" key fires your bunny flamethrower.  

*Disclaimer I do not own any of the sprites used in this game*
